:warning:  dot files

A lot of this was shamelessly stolen from [@jessfraz/dotfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles "jessfraz/dotfiles")

**Install**

````console
$ make
````

This will create symlinks from this repo to your home folder.

**Set zsh as default shell**

```console
$ chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
